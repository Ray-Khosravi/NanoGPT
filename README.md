# NanoGPT
A custom GPT-style Transformer built entirely from scratch in PyTorch. Features hand-coded attention mechanisms and a custom BPE tokenizer trained on the TinyStories dataset for efficient local inference.

𝐁𝐢𝐠 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐧 𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐏𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬: 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦 𝐒𝐋𝐌 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 🚀

In an era obsessed with billion-parameter giants, I decided to go back to first principles to explore the true potential of 𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬 (𝐒𝐋𝐌𝐬).

For this project, I wanted to do more than just fine-tune existing weights. I aimed to understand the architecture. I implemented a GPT-style 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐞𝐫 for the TinyStories dataset entirely from the ground up in 𝐏𝐲𝐓𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐡, without relying on pre-packaged model wrappers.

This project reinforced a key lesson: Architecture comprehension and optimization are just as critical as raw model size. You don't always need a supercomputer to generate creative narratives; sometimes, you just need clean code and the right data.
